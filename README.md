# Riley Davis, Software Engineer at Solo

This is my take on Solo's react challenge, I used a framework called Grommet to assist in keeping the UI tidy and organized. I followed the instructions, basing the layout on the provided example.

I used the provided API to make the network requests to avoid going through CORS. The API is called through localhost:3001, as that's the port I opened the API on on my local machine.

I used the traditional methods of using state calls to re-render child components, and updated the data through property functions that were declared in the app component.

React came across as a more worthwhile demonstration of my skills, as while I do have experience with setting up Node servers, React experience is very high in demand in the software development industry.

If there is any part of the demonstration that did not meet expectations due to a misunderstanding of the instructions on my part, I'd be happy to quickly and efficiently make whatever changes are necessary, thank you.
